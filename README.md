### Description

This is a game I've been working on off and on again for a little while now. It's a top down shooter done using DirectX.  The last upload had a quite a few bugs. This one I've corrected some of the obvious bugs such as the shots sometimes missed enemies despite hitting them. Enemies won't destroy eachother any longer when overlapping. Also I am pretty sure I fixed the bug where nothing appears occasionally when first starting a game. Comments and votes are welcome and appreciated. Thanks
